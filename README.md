# Gems of the Python Standard Library

The Python standard library has a lot of really cool library that I don't see people use to frequently. This talk is meant to help expose a few to help you better hack together a new project or write even more efficient python code!

Also, just a parital disclaimer, not all the code is from me and some of it comes directly from the python documentation.
